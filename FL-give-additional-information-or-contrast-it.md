# Give additional information (AI) or contrast (C) it

## Contrast

* **Despite** growing evidence to the contrary, some feather-brained liberals out there still think these cameras are too evasive.
* **Even if** it means that “the Big Brother” will be watching my every move while I’m out and about, as long as I feel secure, I don’t mind.
* But **in spite of** all the risks, there is still a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong with giving their private information to companies.
* **Much as** we’d love to turn a blind eye to this, data has become a form of capital.
* **Unlike** you and I, corporations don’t have a conscience.
* **Contrary to** popular belief, however, there are steps we can take to combat these questionable data collection practices.
* People still think of them as safe spaces, **whereas** they’re anything but.
* **Even though** Facebook claims they’ve fixed the issue, I believe there are a lot others.

## Additional information

* **Besides**, public surveillance cameras allow to apprehend perpetrators faster.
* I don't feel like eating sushi. **Besides**, I'm broke.
> Note! Don't mix with the word **beside**: *There are  motorcycles are all parked  beside one by one.*
* **Additionally**, in some cases, thanks to outdoor surveillance, crimes can be deterred before they even begin.
* In the meantime, **in addition to this**, just be as cautious about sharing your personal data as possible, I guess.
